== Ajde PHP Web Framework ==

* CONFIGURATION




Directories which have to be writable by the webserver:

- ./private/shared/*


* UNNECESSARY FILES AND DIRECTORIES

Remove these files and directories to cleanup your Ajde install for production:
- ./loadtest.php
- ./phpinfo.php
- ./test/*

* ADDITIONAL LIBRARIES

Those libraries are not included nor required for Ajde to work, but provide additional functionalities:
- ./private/lib/Zend - Zend Framework (http://framework.zend.com/)
- ./test/simpletest - SimpleTest (http://simpletest.org/en/download.html)
